### First of all, note that all this code has been written by itsnotAZ. I forked his code and used it to make my own Bot.

# BlockZ's Helper

## What is this Bot?
BlockZ's Helper is a simple Bot capable of running simple commands. This Bot will be mostly used for announcements, moderation and other tasks.

## Other Features:
